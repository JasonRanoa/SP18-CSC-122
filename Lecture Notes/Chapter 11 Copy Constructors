	11.5 Copy Constructors
	----------------------

... missed class here. No notes found.

There are two ways you can make a copy constructor.
These behave in different ways.
	Say, we have this code:
		Length a, b;
		a = Length(1, 4);
		b = Length(3, 5);

 (1)	Inside the class definition, such as...

			class Length {
			private:
				double Length;
			public:
				// methods
				operator+(Length b)
			}

		Length c = q + b;
		This will not run since this gets interpreted by the
		compiler as a.operator+(b).

 (2)	Outside the class definition, such as...

			class Length {
				...
				// friend operator+
			}
 			Length operator+(Length, a, b) {
				...
			}

		For, Length c = a + b
		The compiler will interpret that as Length::+(a, b)
